## The /shared folder

This folder contains code that is shared and used by more than one of the
examples 1...5, copy-paste example and the default example, the so called
"Hot Reload Playground". Some code is used by all the examples.

In the shared folder there is also "/widgets/universal" folder. That means 
that the widget only depends on Flutter SDK and not even any other 
internal libs. Such widgets are easy to re-use by just copy-pasting
them into other projects.
